# Bioinformatics-SOPs
In place developed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for common bioinformatics data analysis tasks. Some SOPs contain a software workflow as well as corresponding containers with all the necessary software dependencies to run the workflow. 
Below are list of SOPs developed as part of h3abionet consortium funded by NIH USA
1. RNA-Seq (Gene Expression)
